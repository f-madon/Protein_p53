#Computational study of p53 mutations

The tumor suppressor p53 protein is of primary importance for human health, in the response against oncogenic stress signals. P53 is a transcription factor that plays a key function in multiple anti-cancer mechanisms, arrest and regulation of cell cycle, replicative senescence and apoptosis. This key role is confirmed by the fact that p53 is the single most frequently altered protein in cancer. P53 carries out its transcription functions interacting with DNA in tetrameric form by its DNA binding domain (DBD) and more than 90% of oncogenic mutations of p53 are found in the DBD, making it an appealing target of study for new therapeutic strategies. Among the most frequent mutations is that of Arg273 which is located at the protein-DNA binding interface. To get a better understanding of the effects of such mutation on the DNA-p53 binding interaction and on the dynamics of the protein could aim in disclosing relevant mechanisms involved in the dysfunction of the protein. These effects can be studied in silico by using full-atomistic explicit solvent Molecular Dynamics simulations with state-of-the-art force fields. In particular, in this project we report on the computational study of the effects due to the Arg273His mutation byperforming Molecular Dynamics simulations on the free p53 in solution and bounded to DNA. 
In a previous investigation on the wild type p53 protein we showed that long-range conformational changes promoted at the DNA-binding interface upon DNA interaction are coupled to a conformational rearrangement in the loop L5 placed 30 Å apart. Indeed, DNA increases of more than three fold the population of a minor state of the free protein in solution. In this conformation, a p53 interface to recruit biological partners related to p53 transcription-independent functions is shielded. In particular, this is the case for the interaction with Ku70, involved in the apoptotic signalling, and protein kinases implicated in p53 regulation, such as Ark-1. On the other hand the study of the Arg273His mutants shows that binding of DNA does not promote the conformational changes of loop L5 observed in the wild type protein, suggesting that mutation of the Arg273 residue at the DNA-binding interface does not only affect the p53-DNA interaction, but also long range conformational changes that are crucial for transcription-independent functions of the protein.

## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview

This university project is aimed at creating visualizations (interactive and static) to visually represent the data within a dataset.

The phases carried out for this project are: cleaning the dataset, creating the views, heuristic evaluation of the views, evaluation (after the improvements made in the previous phase) through a questionnaire.

The tools used are: python, tableau, figma.

The data was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> for educational purposes.
